# BIA Curriculum
## Objectives
Each member participating in the Curriculum should graduate with core skills that would be reflected in at least 1 **well-done** project. 
Graduated members would then go on to secure analytics-related internships that are of interest to them, bridging BIA fundamentals with industry experience. After gaining these experiences, they would contribute to the curriculum and help mentor the next-generation of BIA members.
